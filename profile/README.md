# FloorMC - The Completely Revamped Minecraft Server

Are you getting bored of the same, old `server.properties` file, and others? Are the standards not **YOUR STANDARDS**? [FloorMC](https://github.com/FloorMC) made a solution nobody needed: [Floor](https://github.com/FloorMC/Floor)!

> The software [Floor](https://github.com/FloorMC/Floor) (by [FloorMC](https://github.com/FloorMC)) is not recommended for massive commercialization currently; please use [PurpurMC](https://github.com/Purpur/PurpurMC) (by [Purpur](https://github.com/Purpur)) until later releases.
